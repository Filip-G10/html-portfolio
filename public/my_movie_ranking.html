<h3>
    Annihilation
</h3>
<p>
    Annihilation just might be my favorite film. 
</p>
<p>
    It deals with human self-destruction.
</p>
<p>
    "As a psychologist, you're confusing sucicide with self-destruction.<br/>
    Almost none of us commit suicide and almost all of us self-destruct. In some way and in some part of our life.<br/>
    We drink or take drugs, destablize the happy job- or happy marriage, but these aren't decisions.<br/>
    They're impulses. In fact, you're probably better equiped to explain this than I am. You're a biologist"

<h3>
    The Ritual
</h3>
<p>
    It is a movie about 5 guys hiking at a forest in Sweden after one of their friends die in a store at the beginning, until they come across a cult and Loki's offspring, Moder.

    This movie is good for techies. People have these contact lenses that allows them to have augmented-reality and record everything. A hacker is able to go about as if they were a ghost by hacking people's AR so that they aren't seen or recorded.
